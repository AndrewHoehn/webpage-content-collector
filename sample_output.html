<p class="wp-block-paragraph" id="speakable-summary">Is the grass greener on the other side? We’re not sure, but the sky is most certainly bluer. It’s been two years since Elon Musk purchased Twitter, now X, leading people to set up shop on alternative platforms. Mastodon, Post, Pebble (two of which have already shuttered operations) and Spill have been presented as potential replacements, but few aside from Meta’s Threads have achieved the speed of growth Bluesky has reached.</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">After being invite-only for almost a year, Bluesky became open to anyone in February 2024 and gained almost 800,000 new users in a day. As of November 2024, Bluesky has over 14.5 million users. Its growth stems from several policy changes at X, including a heavily criticized change to the block feature and allowing third party companies to train their AI on users’ posts, which helped the app soar into the top 5 apps in the U.S. App Store. Bluesky also saw a big boost following the results of the 2024 U.S. presidential election (which also contributed to an X exodus by Taylor Swift fans). But while the number is promising, the network has a lot of catching up to do to compete with Threads’ 275 million monthly active users.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-bluesky">What is Bluesky?</h3>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Bluesky is a decentralized social app conceptualized by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and developed in parallel with Twitter. The social network has a Twitter-like user interface with algorithmic choice, a federated design and community-specific moderation.</p>








<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Bluesky is using an open source framework built in-house, the AT Protocol, meaning people outside of the company have transparency into how it is built and what is being developed.</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Dorsey introduced the Bluesky project back in 2019 while he was still Twitter CEO. At the time, he said Twitter would be funding a “small independent team of up to five open source architects, engineers, and designers,” charged with building a decentralized standard for social media, with the original goal that Twitter would adopt this standard itself. But that was before Elon Musk bought the platform, so Bluesky is completely divorced from Twitter.</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As of May 2024, Dorsey is no longer on Bluesky’s board. Bluesky is now an independent public benefit corporation led by CEO Jay Graber.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-do-you-use-bluesky">How do you use Bluesky?</h3>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Upon signing up, users can create a handle which is then represented as @username.bsky.social as well as a display name that appears more prominent in bold text. If you’re so inclined, you can turn a domain name that you own into your username — so, for example, I’m known on Bluesky as @amanda.omg.lol.</p>


<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The app itself functions much like a bare-bones Twitter, where you can click a plus button to create a post of 256 characters, which can also include photos. Posts themselves can be replied to, retweeted, liked and, from a three-dot menu, reported, shared via the iOS Share Sheet to other apps, or copied as text.</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">You can search for and follow other individuals, then view their updates in your “Home” timeline. Previously, the Bluesky app would feature popular posts in a “What’s Hot” feed. That feed has since been replaced with an algorithmic and personalized “Discover” feed featuring more than just trending content. </p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">For new users, Bluesky introduced a “Starter Pack” feature, which creates a curated list of people and custom feeds to follow in order to find interesting content right out of the gate.</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">User profiles contain the same sort of features you’d expect: a profile pic, background, bio, metrics and how many people they’re following. Profile feeds are divided into two sections, like Twitter: posts and posts &amp; replies.</p>








<p class="wp-block-paragraph">There is also a “Discover” tab in the bottom center of the app’s navigation, which offers more “who to follow” suggestions and a running feed of recently posted Bluesky updates.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-s-on-bluesky">Who’s on Bluesky?</h3>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">By the beginning of July 2023, when Instagram’s Threads launched, Bluesky topped a million downloads across iOS and Android. Notable figures like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Mark Cuban, Dril, Weird Al Yankovic, and even Brazil President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva have migrated to Bluesky. It’s also home to news organizations like Bloomberg, The Washington Post, and of course, TechCrunch! Since August 2024, Bluesky is also now allowing heads of state to sign up and join the platform for the first time.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-does-bluesky-work-just-like-x">Does Bluesky work just like X?</h3>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In many ways, yes. Up until recently, Bluesky did not have DMs like X, but that has since been implemented. However, DMs on Bluesky are currently limited to one-to-one messages, not group messages. Bluesky has also said it is interested in implementing something similar to X’s Community Notes feature. Additionally, X does not use a decentralized protocol like ActivityPub or AT.</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In October 2024, Elon Musk announced that X’s block feature would work differently than it has in the past. The new block functionality allows users you have blocked to view your posts and your profile, but not the ability to interact with your posts. Some users believe this update to be a safety concern, leading to an influx in Bluesky sign-ups as its block feature is more traditional.</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">While Bluesky was initially kicked off as a project convened by Jack Dorsey in 2019 when he was CEO of Twitter, the social app has been an independent company since its inception in 2021.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-bluesky-free">Is Bluesky free?</h3>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Yes, and it is now open to the public.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-does-bluesky-make-money">How does Bluesky make money?</h3>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Bluesky’s goal is to find another means to sustain its network outside of advertising with paid services, so it can remain free to end users. On July 5, 2023, Bluesky announced additional seed round funding and a paid service that provides custom domains for end users who want to have a unique domain as their handle on the service. Bluesky has also emphasized that it does not want to “require selling user data for ads” in order to monetize its platform.</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In November 2024, Bluesky announced it raised a $15 million Series A round and is developing a subscription service for premium features like “higher quality video uploads or profile customizations.” Bluesky, however, noted its subscription model will not follow in the footsteps of X’s “pay to win” premium offerings.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-bluesky-decentralized">Is Bluesky decentralized?</h3>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Yes. Bluesky’s team is developing the decentralized AT Protocol, which Bluesky was built atop. In its beta phase, users can only join the bsky.social network, but Bluesky plans to be federated, meaning that endless individually operated communities can exist within the open source network. So, if a developer outside of Bluesky built their own new social app using the AT Protocol, Bluesky users could jump over to the new app and port over their existing followers, handle and data.</p>








<p class="wp-block-paragraph">“You’ll always have the freedom to choose (and to exit) instead of being held to the whims of private companies or black box algorithms. And wherever you go, your friends and relationships will be there too,” a Bluesky blog post explained.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-bluesky-secure">Is Bluesky secure?</h3>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In October 2023, Bluesky added email verification as part of a larger effort to improve account security and authentication on the network. The addition is an important step forward in terms of making Bluesky more competitive with larger networks like X, which have more robust security controls. In December 2023, Bluesky allowed users to opt out of a change that would expose their posts to the public web following backlash from users. </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-bluesky-customizable">Is Bluesky customizable?</h3>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Yes. In May 2023, Bluesky released custom algorithms, which it calls “custom feeds.” Custom feeds allow users to subscribe to multiple different algorithms that showcase different kinds of posts a user may want to see. You can pin custom feeds that will show up at the top of your timeline as different tabs to pick from. The feeds you pin, or save, are located under the “My Feeds” menu in the app’s sidebar.</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In March 2024,​​ the company announced “AT Protocol Grants,” a new program that will dole out small grants to developers in order to foster growth and customization. One of the recipients, SkyFeed, is a custom tool that lets anyone build their own feeds using a graphical user interface. </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-bluesky-on-ios-and-android">Is Bluesky on iOS and Android?</h3>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Yes. Bluesky rolled out to Android users on April 20 and was initially launched to iOS users in late February. Users can access Bluesky on the web here.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-does-bluesky-tackle-misinformation">How does Bluesky tackle misinformation?</h3>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">After an October 2023 update, the app will now warn users of misleading links by flagging them. If links shared in users’ posts don’t match their text, the app will offer a “possibly misleading” warning to the user to alert them that the link may be directing them somewhere they don’t want to go.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-has-bluesky-had-any-controversies">Has Bluesky had any controversies?</h3>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Bluesky has been embattled with moderation issues since its first launch. The app has been accused of failing to protect its marginalized users and failing to moderate racist content. Following a controversy about the app allowing racial slurs in account handles, frustrated users initiated a “posting strike,” where they refused to engage with the platform until it established guardrails to flag slurs and other offensive terms in usernames.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-moderation-features-does-bluesky-have">What moderation features does Bluesky have?</h3>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">A December 2023 post from the Bluesky Safety account announced a large batch of moderation updates. </p>








<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Bluesky is rolling out “more advanced automated tooling” designed to flag content that violates its Community Guidelines that will then be reviewed by the app’s moderation team. </p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Bluesky launched moderation features similar to ones on X, including user lists and moderation lists, the latter of which can be used to mute or block many users at once. The app is also developing a feature that lets users limit who can reply to posts.</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Some Bluesky users are still advocating for the ability to set their accounts to private — a feature they have an increased need for after Bluesky announced it would launch a public web interface. </p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In March 2024, the company launched Ozone, a tool that lets users create and run their own independent moderation services that will give users “unprecedented control” over their social media experience.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-the-difference-between-bluesky-and-mastodon">What’s the difference between Bluesky and Mastodon?</h3>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Though Bluesky’s architecture is similar to Mastodon’s, many users have found Bluesky to be more intuitive, while Mastodon can come off as inaccessible: Choosing which instance to join feels like an impossible task on Mastodon, and longtime users are very defensive about their established posting norms, which can make joining the conversation intimidating. To remain competitive, Mastodon recently simplified its sign-up flow, making mastodon.social the default server for new users.</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">However, the launch of federation will make it work more similarly to Mastodon in that users can pick and choose which servers to join and move their accounts around at will. </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-owns-bluesky">Who owns Bluesky?</h3>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Though Jack Dorsey funded Bluesky, he is not involved in day-to-day development and no longer sits on the company’s board. The CEO of Bluesky is Jay Graber, who previously worked as a software engineer for the cryptocurrency Zcash, then founded an event-planning site called Happening.</p>

Early and frequent users include author Neil Gaiman and US politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p><p>Users select a username to use Bluesky, shown as “@username.bsky.social” (I snagged @tami.bsky.social). You can also turn a domain name into your username, a feature “ allowing users to self-verify and own their username across the network,” according to the platform.</p><p>Bluesky is very much like Twitter – you can click a Post symbol to write and share 300 characters and include photos. Users can reply, repost, and like posts. You can also indicate the language of your post and highlight if any of your attached images are adult-only.</p><p>Users get three feeds upon joining – Following, Discover, and Popular With Friends, but you can also modify your feeds to see specific types of content.</p><p>Bluesky is currently only available to desktop and iPhone users, with Android access in the works.</p><p>I’ve now been using Bluesky for 6 months and have had sufficient time to really experience the platform as it’s added new features and gone through ups and downs. Here’s my observation of “the good, the bad, and the ugly” of Bluesky.</p><h2 id="the-good">The good</h2><p>Bluesky offers an extensive list of features and benefits that its users (me included) flock to it for. Here are some of them.</p><strong>User control over timelines and content moderation</strong>: Bluesky emphasizes user autonomy, allowing you to dictate your feed and how content is moderated. This ensures a more tailored and empowering user experience.<strong>Open-source and decentralized nature</strong>: Unlike many mainstream platforms, Bluesky operates on an open-source model, promoting transparency and community involvement.<strong>Independence from larger entities</strong>: Despite initial funding and ties to Twitter, Bluesky operates independently, ensuring larger corporations don't influence its decisions.<strong>Account portability</strong>: One of Bluesky's standout features is the AT Protocol, which allows you to move your accounts to another social media site without losing your data or followers. This promotes user freedom and reduces platform lock-in.<strong>Custom domains</strong>: Users can set a custom domain as their handle, providing a personalized touch and borrowing authority from established domain names. Bluesky has integrated features that allow users to purchase and manage domains directly through the platform, enhancing the user experience.<strong>Playful and free environment</strong>: The platform offers a refreshing environment where users can share diverse content, from scenic blue skies to personal anecdotes, without feeling like they must be particularly promotional.<strong>Content moderation flexibility</strong>: Developers running their servers can set their content moderation policies, allowing for a more adaptable approach to content regulation. Bluesky also incorporates community labeling as part of its moderation strategy, promoting community involvement in content regulation.<h2 id="the-bad">The bad</h2><p>Bluesky's vision of a decentralized social media platform is undoubtedly ambitious but not without concerns.</p><strong>Monetization uncertainty</strong>: The exact plans for how Bluesky intends to make money remain unclear. This ambiguity raises questions about its long-term sustainability and how that might affect user experience in the future. There's also a looming concern that Bluesky might drift towards centralization as it grows and evolves, especially if profit overshadows its initial mission. This could undermine the very principles it was built upon.<strong>Limited decentralization in practice</strong>: While Bluesky promotes itself as a decentralized platform, currently, Bluesky Social is the only site using the AT Protocol. This limits the true potential and benefits of decentralization. Some users also question its true intentions and criticize its for-profit nature. They feel that Bluesky might not be genuinely committed to decentralization.<strong>Content moderation challenges</strong>: The flexibility in content moderation, while a strength, can also be a double-edged sword. Different servers with varying moderation policies can lead to inconsistent user experiences and potential safe havens for harmful content.<strong>Dependence on Twitter's infrastructure</strong>: Despite its independence, Bluesky still relies heavily on Twitter's infrastructure, especially for its "birdwatch" feature. This dependence could pose challenges in the future, especially if there are disagreements or conflicts between the two platforms.<strong>Potential for echo chambers</strong>: The ability for users to customize their content feeds and moderation policies can lead to the creation of echo chambers, where users only interact with like-minded individuals, limiting exposure to diverse viewpoints.<strong>Growing pains</strong>: Bluesky is still ironing out technical and operational issues as a relatively new platform. Users might experience bugs, downtimes, or other challenges as the platform scales.<h2 id="the-ugly">The ugly</h2><p>Since its launch, Bluesky has faced controversies that have sparked outrage among community members and reduced trust in the platform's team and their intentions.</p><strong>Challenges with community-driven moderation</strong>: Relying heavily on automated and community-driven content moderation can lead to biases, inconsistencies, and potential misuse. Without a centralized moderation system handled by humans, harmful content might not be addressed uniformly across the platform. This concern was especially shown in Bluseky’s failure to protect Black users and other marginalized groups from racism on the platform. The platform did not prevent users from using racial slurs in their account handles, leading to significant backlash.<strong>Inconsistent communication</strong>: Bluesky's inconsistent communication raises questions about the company's commitment and approach to addressing these issues. Users also pointed out that the team refused to publicly acknowledge their errors in handling the situation, leading to distrust.<strong>Potential for misinformation spread</strong>: The decentralized nature of Bluesky, combined with user-driven content moderation, can create an environment where misinformation or harmful narratives spread unchecked.<strong>Lack of clarity on data privacy</strong>: While Bluesky promises user control and data ownership, the specifics of how user data is handled, stored, and potentially shared remain ambiguous. This lack of transparency can be unsettling for privacy-conscious users.<strong>Potential for platform fragmentation</strong>: The ability for anyone to set up their server with its moderation policies can lead to a fragmented user experience. Depending on their server, users might find themselves in vastly different "versions" of Bluesky.<p>Despite the controversies, the majority of Bluesky’s audience remains highly engaged and is a tight-knit community invested in contributing to the platform.</p><h2 id="should-you-join-bluesky">Should you join Bluesky?</h2><p>Bluesky is definitely worth exploring, especially if you’re after a platform that feels like Twitter. </p><p>Many Twitter users have moved over there and see it as the next best thing, especially over platforms that feel more complex, like Mastodon or don’t feel fully like a Twitter alternative, like Threads. It has also formed an identity quicker than most other Twitter alternatives since it started gaining traction.</p><p>Despite its benefits and even downsides, joining Bluesky should not yet become part of your social media strategy. It's still in its infancy and needs time to evolve into a worthwhile platform for reaching your audience. It also doesn’t have a large enough user base to justify a focus of resources and energy on it.</p><p>I have a couple of invites if you’d like to explore Bluesky.

<p>The Bluesky social app is making waves as a new player in the social media landscape. With millions of users and a range of unique features, it’s helpful for parents to understand how it works and how to keep their kids safe while using it. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-the-bluesky-social-app">What is the Bluesky Social App?</h2>
<p>Bluesky is a social networking app developed by a team led by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. It was designed to offer a fresh take on social media. It emphasizes open source principles, meaning its code is publicly available and can be contributed to or modified by developers around the globe. </p>
<p>Bluesky also utilizes a decentralized protocol, known as the AT Protocol.  Rather than relying on a single server or company, it distributes data across multiple nodes. This approach supports a more transparent and adaptable social network. </p>
<p>It’s available on both iOS and Android platforms, as well as desktop.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-similarities-to-other-social-media-platforms">Similarities to Other Social Media Platforms</h3>
<p>Often compared to the old Twitter (now X), Bluesky allows users to create accounts where they can follow other users, share posts (unofficially called skeets), engage with content, mention others by using the @ symbol followed by the username, and share images and videos with a maximum length of around 10 minutes. Users can include hashtags in their posts to categorize content and make it discoverable.</p>
<p>Once an account has been created, profiles can be personalized with a profile picture, cover photo, and a bio of up to 160 characters.</p>

<p>Bluesky has an Explore tab where users can explore trending topics, popular posts, and discover new accounts. Users can also use the search function to search for posts, hashtags, and profiles using keywords. </p>
<p>Direct messaging on Bluesky is a newer feature as of May 2024. DMs currently support one-to-one messages, not group messages. The default setting only allows the user to receive DMs from people who they follow, but this setting can be changed to everyone or no one.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-unique-features">Unique Features</h3>
<p>Users can compose text posts with up to 300 characters — more than X’s 280 character limit on regular accounts, but much less than Threads’ 500.</p>
<p>Bluesky allows users to curate their own timelines with custom feeds. This feature lets users control their content consumption by curating their feeds and following accounts based on their preferences, rather than being subject to a one-size-fits-all moderation policy.</p>
<p>Because of its decentralized protocol, Bluesky believes everything should be open to the public, and that includes all accounts. Any account on Bluesky is viewable to the public, with no way to make it private.</p>
<p>To address concerns about inappropriate content, Bluesky includes content filters and moderation lists to help manage what appears on a user’s feed. </p>
<p>Bluesky also stands out by offering an ad-free experience, allowing users to engage with the platform without interruptions from promotional content. This focus on a clean, user-centric environment aims to enhance the quality of interactions and maintain a more genuine online space.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-bluesky-safe-for-kids">Is Bluesky Safe for Kids?</h2>
<p>Bluesky is rated 17+ on both Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store, making it not suitable for younger audiences. </p>
<p>Bluesky’s content filters and moderation lists are designed to help manage inappropriate content, but they are not foolproof. Parents should be aware that while these tools can significantly reduce exposure to harmful material, they do not eliminate all risks.</p>
<p>The platform relies heavily on “self-labeling,” where users add labels to their posts warning of inappropriate content. </p>
<p>The app’s algorithm that learns from user interactions can create highly personalized feeds. While this can be a benefit, it also means that children might be exposed to content that aligns with their interests and curiosities but might not always be age-appropriate.</p>
<p>The open-source aspect of Bluesky means that its features and safety measures can be reviewed and improved continuously. However, it also requires users and parents to stay informed about any updates or changes that could affect their children’s experience.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tips-for-keeping-safe-on-bluesky">Tips for Keeping Safe on Bluesky</h2>
<p>If you decide to allow your child to use Bluesky, make use of the app’s content filters and moderation lists to control your scroll. Regularly review these settings to ensure they are effective.</p>
<p>Have open conversations with your kids about online safety and the importance of privacy. Encourage them to report any inappropriate content or behavior they encounter.</p>
<p>The Bluesky social app offers a fresh and innovative approach to social networking with features like custom feeds, an advanced algorithm, and content filters. While it provides tools to manage content and personalize user experiences, it’s crucial for parents to actively engage in their children’s online activities to ensure their safety. </p>

<p>By understanding how Bluesky works and implementing appropriate safety measures, you can help your kids navigate this new social network responsibly.</p>
<p>Because the Bluesky app is available on both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, any device with access to those stores will give a child easy access to Bluesky. Despite being rated 17+, age verification can be easily bypassed.</p>
<p>If you feel your child is ready for a smartphone, but not ready for social media apps like Bluesky, you might consider kid-safe tech that prevents the download of social media apps altogether.</p>

We’re creating a version of social media where it's built by many people, and it still comes together as a cohesive, easy-to-use experience. We've done this by building Bluesky on the<!-- --> AT Protocol, an open source toolbox for building social apps that can all talk to each other.</p><p>We want modern social media and public conversation online to work more like the early days of the web, when anyone could put up a blog or use RSS to subscribe to several blogs. We believe this will unlock a new era of experimentation and innovation in social media. Researchers and communities will have the ability to jump in to help solve the problems social networks currently face, and developers will be able to experiment with many new forms of interaction.<!-- --> </p><p>Traditional social networks are often closed platforms with a central authority. There’s a small group of people who control those companies, and they have total control over how users can use the platform and what developers can build. On these platforms, as a user, if you try to leave, you have to start over from scratch without the connections you built there or the content you made. As a developer, if you try to build a new app, you have to overcome network effects to rebuild the social graph from scratch, and if you<!-- --> try to build on the APIs <!-- -->of these companies they can cut you off and kill your company in the blink of an eye. As a creator, you might spend years building an audience only to lose access to it when the platform changes the rules on you.</p><p></p><h2>What is the AT Protocol? </h2><p>The AT Protocol is a protocol for public conversation and an open-source framework for building social apps, meaning people have transparency into how it is built and what is being developed. It creates a standard format for user identity, follows, and data on social apps, allowing apps to interoperate and users to move across them freely. It is a federated network with account portability.<!-- --> </p><p>An analogy to explain this: every time you create an account on a social platform, it’s like moving to a new city. You make friends and create posts, which is like filling your house with furniture you made. But on centralized social platforms, if you leave, it's like leaving all your friends behind with no way to contact them, and leaving your house behind without being able to take anything with you. Leaving a centralized site and starting over from scratch is very hard.</p><p>The AT Protocol essentially lets people move between cities. Creating a standard format for identity and data is like giving people a passport, cell phone, and property rights. If you don’t like the city you first moved to, you can relocate and take all your belongings (data) with you. Your friends will still be able to find and stay in touch with you at the same name and number (identity &amp; follow graph).</p><p>The AT Protocol offers account portability, as well as<!-- --> algorithmic choice <!-- -->and<!-- --> composable moderation, which you can read more about in the linked blog posts.</p><p></p><h2>How are Bluesky (and AT Protocol) different from Mastodon (and ActivityPub)?<!-- --> </h2><p>Mastodon is another federated social network built on a protocol called ActivityPub. While Bluesky — built on AT Protocol — shares the term “federation” with other networks, the way it works is very different.</p><p>On Bluesky, server choice doesn’t affect what content you see. Servers are only one piece of the protocol — when you browse Bluesky, you see posts that are pulled together from many different servers. This is why you can change your server after signing up without losing your username, friends, or posts.</p><p>A summary of some ways Bluesky differs from Mastodon:</p><p><b>A focus on the global conversation:</b> On Mastodon, your “instance”, or server, determines your community, so your experience depends on which server you join. An instance can send and receive posts from other instances, but it doesn’t try to offer a global view of the network. Your Mastodon server is part of your username, and becomes part of your identity. On Bluesky, your experience is based on what feeds and accounts you follow, and you can always participate in the global conversation (e.g. breaking news, viral posts, and algorithmic feeds). You can use your own domain name as your username, and continue participating from anywhere your account is hosted.<b>Composable moderation:</b> Moderation on Bluesky is not tied to your server, like it is on Mastodon. Defederation, a way of addressing moderation issues in Mastodon by disconnecting servers, is not as relevant on Bluesky because there are other layers to the system. Server operators can set rules for what content they will host, but tools like blocklists and moderation services are what help communities self-organize around moderation preferences. We’ve already integrated block and mute lists, and the tooling for independent moderation services is coming soon.<b>Composable feeds:</b> We designed your timeline on Bluesky so that it’s not tied to your server. Anyone can build a feed, and there are currently over 40,000 algorithmic feeds to choose from. Your Mastodon timeline is only made up of posts from accounts you follow, and does not pull together posts from the whole network like Bluesky’s custom feeds.<b>Account portability:</b> We designed federated hosting on Bluesky so that you can move servers easily. Moving hosting services should be like changing your cell phone provider — you should be able to keep your identity and data. Changing servers on Bluesky doesn’t disrupt your username, friends, or posts.</p><p></p><h2>What is the corporate structure of Bluesky?</h2><p>Bluesky, the company, is a Public Benefit Corporation. It is owned by Jay Graber and the Bluesky team. The board consists of Jay Graber and Jeremie Miller, the inventor of Jabber/XMPP. Find past public statements we have made about Bluesky PBC's governance and structure in our<!-- --> original announcement,<!-- --> other posts <!-- -->on our<!-- --> blog, and<!-- --> on social media.</p><p></p><h2>What is the relationship between Bluesky and Twitter?</h2><p>Bluesky was initially a<!-- --> project kicked off by Jack Dorsey <!-- -->when he was CEO of Twitter in 2019. Jack<!-- --> chose Jay to lead Bluesky, and Twitter paid Bluesky services income to build an open social protocol for public conversation that it could someday become a client on. Bluesky<!-- --> has been an independent company <!-- -->since its<!-- --> formation in 2021.</p><p>In late 2022, Twitter chose to sever the service agreement with Bluesky, and Bluesky agreed. The Bluesky PBC has continued to pursue its original founding mission to “develop and drive large-scale adoption of technologies for open and decentralized public conversation.”</p><p></p><h2>How many people are on the app?</h2><p>As of November 2024, Bluesky has over 13 million users.</p><p></p><h2>How do I join Bluesky?</h2><p>Sign up for Bluesky at<!-- --> bsky.app. (No invites required!)</p><p></p><h2>What is your plan for moderation?</h2><p>Our approach to moderation is three-fold: automated filtering, manual admin actions, and community labeling. It stacks new approaches to moderation on top of what centralized social sites already do, and exposes the internals of the system for anyone to observe.</p><p>The open and composable labeling system for moderation we’re creating will allow anyone to define and apply labels to content or accounts, and lets anyone choose to subscribe to these label sets. Labels can be automatically or manually generated, and can be applied by any service or person in the network.</p><p>For more information, read our original<!-- --> blog post on composable moderation.</p><p></p><p><i>For FAQ about the AT Protocol, please visit<!-- --> here.</i></p><p><i>For media inquiries, please contact press@blueskyweb.xyz.</i></p></main>
